## Have you ever had to deal with CORS issues?

When building our page, sometimes we get an error related to CORS. Usually, we get something like this: "... blocked by CORS policy".
This means that we aren't able to make our request to the server (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc).
<br/>
Lucky for us, there is a nice and easy way of solving this problem. The only thing we have to do is go to our project's console, and once there, we enter the `npm i cors` command. This will install a package that will deal
with our CORS problems.
<br/>
<br/>
Then we have to go to the file where we got our server running and write the following lines of code: 

 ### `const cors = require('cors')`

 ### `app.use(cors())`

 ### React.js code

```src/index.js
const express = require('express');
const yourServer = require('yourServer')
const app = express();

const cors = require('cors')
app.use(cors())


```
